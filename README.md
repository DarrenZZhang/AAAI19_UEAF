# Unified Embedding Alignment with Missing Views Inferring for Incomplete Multi-View Clustering
This is an example implementation of our paper [our paper](https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2020/0447.pdf):

Jie Wen, Zheng Zhang, Yong Xu, Bob Zhang, Lunke Fei, Hong Liu, Unified Embedding Alignment with Missing Views Inferring for Incomplete Multi-View Clustering, AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, 2019, 5393-5400.

This code has been evaluated on Matlab. 

Note: tune parapeters lambda1, lambda2, lambda3, neighbor, and r to achieve the best results. (Generally, you can set neighbor = 7, and r = 3 in most cases.)

Influneced by the initilzation of k-means or the matlab versions, the clustering results may have little deviations to the reuslts reported in the paper.
